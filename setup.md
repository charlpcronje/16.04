# Setup via Virtual Box

I am going under the assumption that the drive I gave you is mounted on drive letter H:

- Open Virtual Box
- Click on `Machine` in the main menu
- Click on `Add`
- Browse to h:\Ubuntu 16.04 LTS\Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.vbox
- Click on Open

Now the VM should be in the list to open, double click on the new VM to run
